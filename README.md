This page contains data visualizations from my explorations of NACSW's trial results data. If you'd like to explore this data yourself to find cool insights or do your own data analysis or make your own model predictions, the data I scraped for my analysis is available at [link-to-be-added]().  

## Context

[NACSW](https://www.nacsw.net/about-us-0) is a US organization that arranges canine scent detection competitions. Think a for-fun version of the kind of work a sniffer dog does when they're screening luggage at an airport.

Dogs that compete in NACSW trials are trained to detect 3 target odors - Birch, Anise and Clove. At the trials, cotton swabs or similar items scented with one or more of these odors are hidden out of view. The dogs must source the locations of the hides and indicate to their handler who reports the find to the judge. If the team has correctly sourced a hide, they earn points for it. Teams must succeed in diverse environments searching for hides in indoor locations, outdoor locations, on vehicles and in containers. The number of hides, search areas and complexity of the scent puzzles the teams encounter increases with increasing levels of competition.
