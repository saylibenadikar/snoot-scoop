This repository contains the R code used to produce my visualizations as I explore NACSW's publicly posted [trial results](https://www.nacsw.net/trial-results) (see the section below for context). 

The data was scraped by me and is available at [link-to-be-added]().  

## Context

[NACSW](https://www.nacsw.net/about-us-0) organizes canine scent detection dog sport competitions in North America.

Dogs that compete are trained to detect 3 target odors - Birch, Anise and Clove. At the trials, cotton swabs scented with one or more of these odors are hidden out of view. The dogs must source the locations of the hides, then indicate to their handler who reports the find to the judge. If the team has correctly sourced a hide, they get points for it. Teams must succeed in diverse environments searching for hides in indoor locations, outdoor locations, on vehicles and in containers. The number of hides, search areas and complexity of the scent puzzles increases with increasing levels of competition. 

Trial rule book is [available here](https://www.nacsw.net/trial-information/trial-rule-book).
