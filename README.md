# [NACSW](https://www.nacsw.net/) Fan ~~Fiction~~ Facts

This page contains data visualizations from my explorations of NACSW's publicly posted [trial results data](https://www.nacsw.net/trial-results). If you like data and dogs or are an NACSW enthusiast and would like to do your own explorations to find cool insights or make predictions, the data I scraped for my analysis is available as a dataset on [kaggle]().  

## Context

[NACSW](https://www.nacsw.net/about-us-0) is an organization in the US that arranges well-structured and super fun canine scent detection competitions. Think a for-fun version of the kind of work a sniffer dog does when they're screening luggage at an airport.

Dogs that compete in NACSW are trained to detect 3 target odors - Birch, Anise and Clove. At the trials, cotton swabs or similar items scented with one or more of these odors are hidden out of view. The dogs must source the locations of the hides and indicate to their handler who reports the find to the judge. If the team correctly sources a hide, they earn points for it. Teams work in diverse environments searching for hides in indoor locations, outdoor locations, on vehicles and in containers. The number of hides, search area sizes and complexity of the scent puzzles the teams encounter increases with increasing levels of competition. 

Full trial rule book is [available here](https://www.nacsw.net/trial-information/trial-rule-book).

Here's a trial video of a team at a beginner level

## Popularity over Time and Space
This venue held its first sanctioned trials in 2009 in California. Since then the sport has grown in other parts of the country. This first exploration looks at how the number of beginner level (NW1) trials changed over the years since 2009. How seasonality changes these numbers. And what impact the COVID-19 lockdowns had on these numbers.
