## Question To Explore

How have the **levels of competition** offered every year evolved over time?

## How to Read the Visualization
The percent stacked column chart below shows the relative proportions of trials at the various competition levels. Each row corresponds to a year from 2009. The segments within each row correspond to various levels of competition. The length of the segment indicates the proportion of trials that year at that competition level expressed as a percentage of total trials that year. 

## Observations
As the sport has matured, higher levels of competition have been added to the mix presumably to cater to the existing competitors as those teams advance past currently offered levels.
