## Question To Explore

How did the popularity of this dog sport and venue, as measured by the number of trials hosted, change over **time**?

## How to Read the Visualization
The heatmap below shows the total number of trials hosted across all NACSW trial sites. Each column represents a year between 2009 and 2021. Each row corresponds to a month in a calendar year. The color of each cell is selected based on the number of trials hosted in the month and year that intersect at that cell. 

## Observations
- Hotter cells to the right of the map indicate popularity increasing over the years
- There appears to be a seasonality to this sport, with Fall and Spring months being the busiest months in any given year
- The blank region in the 2020 column is presumably due to COVID-19 related lockdowns. But trials resumed and hit an all time high the following year in Fall 2021.
