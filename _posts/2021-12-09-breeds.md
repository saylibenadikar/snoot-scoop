## Question To Explore

What are the top breeds in this sport. By what definition of top?

## Data

Mixed breed competitor dogs were non-trivial to handle from a data analysis perspective, so for now I have filtered them out. Specifically, what was tricky about mixes was:
1. parsing the various user-input breed combination names and short forms correctly to group similar mixes into a single category and 
2. attributing a mixed breed dog's performance to a component breed without knowing the percentage composition (e.g. a Lab x Pittie mix can be 99% or 50% or 1% Pittie, or not a Pittie at all if no genetic testing had been done on the dog) 

I would like to add a visualization that is inclusive of and provides more insight into the mixed breed dogs but for now data analyzed in this post will be of dogs that are *not* mixed breeds.

## How to Read the Visualizations
1. The animation in the first visualization examines the 5 breeds that make up the highest proportion of dogs from any breed competing at Summit level competitions. The growth/shrinkage in proportion of dogs from this breed from beginner levels (L1, NW1) through intermediate levels right up to Summit is tracked in the animation.
2. The second visualization shows what percentage of dogs from a given breed competing at beginner levels makes it up to Summit level competition.

## Observations
- **Labrador Retrievers** are really good at this game! Not only do they have a good representation in terms of sheer numbers in beginner levels of competition, but they don't wash out, they continue to excel in the higher levels.
- Breeds like the **English Springer Spaniel** may not make up a huge percentage of the total dogs competing but the proportion of dogs from these breeds that continues to excel from lower through higher levels of competition is much higher than the average breed.
