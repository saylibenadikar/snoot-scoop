## Question To Explore

Where, **geographically**, has this sport/venue grown to from its foundation in California?

## How to Read the Visualizations
1. In the geographical heatmap in the first visualization below the color of a state's square represents the number of trials that state has hosted since 2009 to 2021.

2. The second visualization is a traditional map of the Continental US with bubbles at locations of trial sites. Large red and orange bubbles indicate locations that have hosted a large number of trials. Smaller blue and green ones depict sites that have hosted a smaller number of trials.  

## Observations
- (Viz 1) Unsurprisingly (as the sport started in California), California leads in the total number trials hosted
- (Viz 1) Oregon, Washington, Colorado, Illinois, Pennsylvania have all hosted a significant number of trials
- (Viz 2) At first look, amongst the top 6 states to host the most trials, Colorado looks interesting in that it has more unique trial locations (larger number of blue and green circles) as compared to some of the east and west coast hubs where there appear to be super-sites (locations hosting many trials depicted by large orange bubbles). This observation needs some more exploration to validate.
