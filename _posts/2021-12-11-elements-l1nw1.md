## Question To Explore
Is one search element (amongst Interior, Exterior, Vehicle, Container) the most difficult for all dogs on average? By what definition of difficult?

## Data
Only teams competing in L1 or NW1 were included in this analysis. At these levels, there is a single hide per element, and there are no blank hides, so comparing times from trial to trial is possible.

## How to Read the Visualization
The ridgeline graphs at the top of the visualization below show time to find the hide on the x-axis. In the left column is L1 data, in the right column is NW1 data. The different colors correspond to different elements. Peaks indicate a large number of teams found the hide within the time where the peak occurs. Each element is sub-divided into 4 quantiles regions. The region inside each quantile corresponds to 25% of the total teams. Shorter times to find hide are preferred over longer times.

The column charts below the ridgeline graphs show the pass rate for each element and level. Higher pass rates are preferred.

## Observations
- Container poses an interesting challenge. Teams seem to take the shortest amount of time to find Container hides (top ridgeline graphs) but this element also has the lowest pass rate (bottom bar graphs for L1 and NW1)
- Vehicle appears to be more difficult on average than Interior/Exterior both in terms of time to find hide as well as pass rate
