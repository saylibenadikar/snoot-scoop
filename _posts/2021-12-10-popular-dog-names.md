## Question To Explore
What are the most popular names of dogs competing in this sport?

## How to Read the Visualization
The column chart at the top of the visualization below examines the top 10 most popular names from all time to show how many competitor dogs had that name.

The line graphs below examine the most popular name from every year since 2009 in addition to the 10 all-time popular names to see how all these names trended over time. 

## Observations
- Bella has had a good run, but watch out, Piper and Finn may be out to get you!
- There are more female names in this list than male names. Is it that female dogs represent a higher proportion of dogs in this sport? Or is it because female dogs are named slightly less uniquely than male dogs?
- It would be nice in future explorations to see:
  - how these names correlate with year-wise popular baby names (are the trends in sync, or slightly offset or not correlated at all?)
  - if the same trends hold true in the general dog population outside of scent work and NACSW
