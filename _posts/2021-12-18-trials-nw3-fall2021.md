## Question To Explore

How did trial performance for a particular level at a particular point in time, say NW3 in Fall 2021, look when viewed across all trials across the country?

## How to Read the Visualization
Every sub-plot corresponds to a unique NW3 trial. Trial date and location are indicated in the title of the sub-plot. Each sub-plot shows the distribution of scores at that trial via a histogram. The x axis shows score bins and the y axis the number of teams that earned scores that were in that score bin. Red bars indicate lower scores, green bars indicate higher scores. Short bars indicate fewer teams in that score bin while taller bars indicate more teams in that score bin.

## Observations
No notable observation other than the obvious fact that some trials are harder than others with lower pass rates on the whole.
